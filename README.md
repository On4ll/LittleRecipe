# LittleRecipe  

LittleRecipe calculates food recipe combinations based on given conditions for the game **Elin**.  

While it provides the best possible results for most recipes, the calculations are **approximate** due to the many **variants** of the same food items in the game. Additionally, for recipes with more than 2â€“3 ingredients, the number of possible combinations becomes too large for normal computers to check exhaustively.  

### Accuracy and Performance  
- Applying too many filtering conditions may exclude some valid recipe combinations, but this is rare.  
- If you have a powerful PC, you can **increase the computation depth** in the settings to search for additional recipes that might otherwise be discarded due to providing only **small stat increases**.
